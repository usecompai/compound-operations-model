"""Delete Ledger — tracks RTBF deletions with propagation status.

Each deletion targets a subject_id (resolved from email/phone/etc via the
Subject Registry) and creates a ledger entry. A propagation worker touches
every store and marks each column done. Until all columns are done, the
deletion is PENDING and reportable via `compai-init ingest forget --status`.

Realistic SLAs (by column):
    evidence_done:      <5 min
    retrieval_done:     <5 min
    qmd_reindex_done:   <15 min (cron tick)
    summaries_done:     <1h
    logs_done:          <24h (log rotation)
    backups_done:       <30d (backup retention)
    llm_provider_done:  <30d without ZDR, immediate with ZDR
