## 1. Description of Processing

### 1.1 System Overview
Multi-agent AI system composed of [AGENT COUNT] scoped runtimes plus [COMMAND CLIENTS], processing the declared operational domains. Runtimes use the providers and model versions recorded in the dated runtime registry: [REGISTRY REFERENCE].

### 1.2 Agents and Their Data Access

| Agent | Personal Data Processed | Purpose | Volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS Agent | Customer names, emails, order history, complaint content | Draft CS responses, ticket triage, pattern detection | ~50 tickets/day |
| Finance Agent | Employee names (payroll), supplier names, invoice data | P&L reports, AR tracking, invoice reconciliation | ~20 invoices/month |
| Marketing Agent | Customer email addresses (via Klaviyo segments), campaign engagement data | Campaign analysis, segmentation, attribution | ~15K email profiles |
| Retail Agent | Aggregated foot traffic (no PII), POS transaction data (no card data) | Store reports, staffing recommendations | ~500 transactions/day |
| Merch Agent | Wholesale partner contact names, order data | Sell-through analysis, wholesale ops | ~30 B2B accounts |
| Strategy Agent | Cross-domain summaries (derived, not raw PII) | Morning briefings, coordination | Aggregated data only |
| HR Agent | Employee names, absence dates, vacation balances, department, payroll changes | Absence reports, payroll prep, vacation tracking | 44 employees |
| Claude Code | All of the above (founder interface) | On-demand queries across all domains | Ad-hoc |

### 1.3 Data Sources

| Source System | Data Type | Access Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Shopify | Orders, customers, products, inventory | API (read + limited write) |
| the helpdesk | CS tickets, customer conversations | API (read + draft write) |
| Klaviyo | Email profiles, campaign data, segments | API (read + limited write) |
| the accounting system | Invoices, contacts, treasury, employee records | API (read) |
| the accounting system Leaves | Employee absences, vacation balances | Web scraper (read-only) |
| the expense platform | Expenses, corporate cards, bank statements | API (read) |
| the POS/inventory system | Inventory, warehouse stock, wholesale orders | API (read + write) |
| Google Workspace | Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets | API via Domain-Wide Delegation |
| Notion | HR databases, onboarding checklists, policies | API (read + write) |
| TC Analytics | Foot traffic (aggregated, no PII) | Scraper (read) |
| Meta Ads | Campaign performance (aggregated, no PII) | API (read) |
| GA4 | Web analytics (aggregated, no PII) | API (read) |

### 1.4 Data Flow

```
Source Systems → MCP Server (VPS, Germany) → Agent Processing → Output
                                                    ↓
                                           Brain (knowledge base)
                                           Memory (daily logs)
                                           Audit (JSONL logs)
```

All data stays within EU infrastructure. LLM API calls transmit prompts to Anthropic (US) and OpenAI (US) servers — these are processed under API terms (no training, no retention beyond request processing).

## 2. Legal Basis (GDPR Article 6)

| Data Category | Legal Basis | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Customer data (orders, tickets) | Art. 6(1)(b) — Contract performance | Processing orders and handling support requests |
| Customer email profiles | Art. 6(1)(f) — Legitimate interest | Marketing optimization (with opt-out via Klaviyo) |
| Employee data (HR) | Art. 6(1)(b) — Employment contract | Payroll processing, absence management |
| Employee data (monitoring) | N/A — **not performed** | HR agent explicitly prohibited from performance monitoring |
| Supplier/partner data | Art. 6(1)(f) — Legitimate interest | Invoice processing, wholesale operations |
| Aggregated analytics | N/A — no PII | Store traffic, campaign metrics |

## 3. Necessity and Proportionality

### 3.1 Why AI Agents vs Manual Processing?
- [TEAM SIZE]-person company with documented operational bottlenecks
- Estimated hours reclaimed are recorded in the deployment's own ROI model
- Human oversight is maintained through identity, capability authority, review, rollback and receipts
- Alternatives and proportionality are assessed for this deployment rather than copied from the reference case

### 3.2 Data Minimization
- Each agent only accesses data relevant to its domain (principle of least privilege)
- Finance agent cannot access CS tickets; CS agent cannot access salary data
- API keys are domain-scoped; no agent has unrestricted access
- Aggregated data preferred over individual records where possible

### 3.3 Storage Limitation
| Data Type | Retention | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Agent memory logs | 90 days rolling | VPS (Germany) |
| Brain knowledge base | Indefinite (operational knowledge) | VPS + Mac Mini (synced) |
| Audit logs (JSONL) | 90 days, then archived | VPS |
| LLM conversation context | Session-only (cleared on compaction) | VPS + Mac Mini |
| Customer data in source systems | Per source system policy | Shopify/Klaviyo/the accounting system clouds |

## 4. Risk Assessment

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | CS agent sends incorrect information to customer | Medium | Low | **Low** — human reviews all drafts before sending |
| R2 | HR agent exposes salary data | Low | High | **Low** — salary access restricted to CEO only in SOUL.md |
| R3 | Agent follows injected instructions from customer message | Low | Medium | **Low** — anti-prompt-injection in all SOULs |
| R4 | Employee data leaked via brain sync | Very Low | High | **Very Low** — brain syncs only .md files, salary data in the accounting system not brain |
| R5 | LLM provider uses company data for training | Very Low | High | **Very Low** — API terms prohibit training; no consumer products used |
| R6 | Agent makes biased employment decision | N/A | N/A | **N/A** — HR agent prohibited from employment decisions (EU AI Act guardrails) |
| R7 | Data breach via VPS/Mac Mini compromise | Low | High | **Low** — Tailscale mesh (encrypted), loopback gateway binding, UFW firewall |
| R8 | Unauthorized employee accesses agent data | Low | Medium | **Low** — OS-level user separation on Mac Mini, brain access via MCP auth |

## 5. Mitigation Measures

### Technical
- [x] EU data residency (Hetzner Germany + Mac Mini Spain)
- [x] Tailscale encrypted mesh networking (zero open ports)
- [x] Gateway loopback binding (no direct external access)
- [x] OS-level user separation per agent on Mac Mini
- [x] API-only LLM usage (no training on data)
- [x] Anti-prompt-injection in all agent SOULs
- [x] JSONL audit logging with 90-day retention

### Organizational
- [x] Human manager assigned to each agent
- [x] Capability-specific authority; confidence never grants permission
- [x] Shadow mode for new agent deployments
- [x] Quarterly compliance review scheduled
- [x] Incident reporting procedure documented
- [x] HR agent explicitly prohibited from employment decisions

### Contractual
- [x] Anthropic API terms reviewed — no data training, no retention
- [x] OpenAI API terms reviewed — no data training, no retention
- [x] Shopify/Klaviyo/the accounting system DPAs in place (standard SaaS agreements)
