# The Compound Operations Model
## An Open-Source AI Operations Playbook for Consumer SMEs

**By Compai** · Open-source educational portfolio · Built inside a profitable brand growing 100%+ annually · Repo: github.com/darthe company/compound-operations-model

### What This Is

This is not a strategy deck. It's not a trend report. It's not thought leadership.

This is the operational blueprint built — and running — inside a profitable European consumer brand. Eight-figure revenue, healthy EBITDA, 100%+ annual growth, ~40-person team. Seven AI agents in production plus a founder command center — full system cost **€352/month**, verified value **€77K/year** in reclaimed labor hours. **18:1 ROI with every assumption on the table.** The source is published as an educational portfolio so other consumer SMEs can fork the repo, read the playbook, and adapt the patterns.

Everything in this playbook is real. The architectures are running. The configs are from production systems. The numbers are audited.

### The Thesis

For every dollar a brand spends on software, it spends six on services and headcount to operate that software. Shopify costs €2K/year. The people managing inventory, processing orders, answering tickets, and closing the books cost €200K+.

Most AI tools sell another dashboard. **This playbook documents the operating layer above the dashboards.**

Every improvement in AI models makes the system faster, cheaper, and easier for operators to adapt. We are not positioning this as a SaaS product or a paid repo. We are publishing the working architecture, the lessons, and the artifacts so consumer SMEs can fork the repo, inspect the assumptions, and build their own version.

### Who This Is For

Consumer SME operators — beauty, food & beverage, home, wellness, pet, outdoor, fashion, and retail — running on Shopify or a similar commerce stack with €2M–50M in revenue. You have a ~40-person team. Multiple channels. And operations that are creaking under growth.

If you've been told you need to hire 3 more people, this playbook shows you a different path.

### The Compound Operations Model™

We've organized this playbook around the open operating model used in the reference deployment:

1. **Integrate** — Connect your systems into a unified data layer
2. **Specialize** — Deploy purpose-built AI agents per operational domain
3. **Orchestrate** — Make agents coordinate across functions
4. **Compound** — Let the system get smarter every day
