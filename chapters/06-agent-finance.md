# Chapter 6: Agent #3 — Finance & Reporting (Finance Agent)

## The CFO That Never Sleeps

Most brands under €20M don't have a CFO. They have a founder who hates spreadsheets, an accountant who comes once a month, and a bookkeeper who's always 3 weeks behind.

The Finance Agent changes this by turning financial data into real-time, actionable intelligence.

## What the Finance Agent Does

### 1. Automated P&L Generation

Every Monday morning at 7:00 AM, the Finance Agent delivers a weekly P&L to the founder's inbox. Not a spreadsheet to interpret — a narrative summary:

> **Week 10 Summary (Mar 3-9, 2026)**
>
> Revenue: +12% WoW, +23% YoY
> - DTC Online: 39% of revenue
> - Wholesale: 32%
> - Store A (flagship): 13%
> - Store B (neighborhood): 9%
> - Department Store: 7%
>
> Gross Margin: 67.8% (target: 67%) ✅
> EBITDA margin: 8.6% — trending toward 10.7% annual target
>
> ⚠️ Flag: Shipping costs +18% vs. last week. Cause: 3PL surcharge for oversized packages (new product collection). Recommend negotiating volumetric pricing.
>
> 🟢 Cash runway: 6+ months at current burn rate.

### 2. Invoice Processing & Reconciliation

- Extracts data from supplier invoices (PDF/email)
- Matches invoices against POs and delivery notes
- Flags discrepancies: "Invoice from Supplier X is higher than PO amount. Possible: extra units shipped?"
- Queues approved invoices for payment

### 3. Cash Flow Forecasting

- Projects 4-week cash flow based on:
  - Historical revenue patterns
  - Known upcoming expenses (rent, salaries, supplier payments)
  - Outstanding wholesale receivables
  - Seasonal adjustments
- Alerts when projected cash drops below safety threshold

### 4. Tax & Compliance Prep

- Tracks all transactions for quarterly VAT filing
- Separates domestic vs. intra-EU vs. international sales
- Prepares data export compatible with accounting software (Xero, QBO, A3)
- Flags transactions that need human review for tax categorization

### 5. Board / Investor Reporting

- Monthly executive summary with KPIs
- Quarterly board deck data preparation
- YoY comparisons, trend analysis, cohort data
- Exportable to Google Slides / Notion

# Finance Agent — Finance Agent

You are Finance Agent, the financial intelligence agent. Los números son sagrados — nunca inventas uno.

## Mission
Provide accurate, timely, actionable financial data.
Make the founder feel like they have a real CFO.

## Communication Style
- Precise. Numbers always rounded to meaningful precision.
- Contextualized. Never report a number without comparison (WoW, MoM, YoY, vs target).
- Highlight exceptions, not norms. If something is on track, say so briefly. If something is off, explain why and recommend action.
- Use plain language. The audience is a founder, not an accountant.

## Rules
- NEVER make financial decisions autonomously (payments, transfers, investments)
- ALWAYS flag when actual differs from forecast by > 10%
- Revenue recognition: only count when order is fulfilled, not when placed
- Multi-currency: always convert to EUR using daily ECB rate
- Wholesale revenue: recognize on shipment, not on invoice

## Reporting Schedule
- Daily: Quick revenue snapshot (by channel)
- Weekly: Full P&L + narrative (Monday 7AM)
- Monthly: Executive summary + cash flow projection
- Quarterly: Board-ready KPI package
```

### Key Integrations

| Integration | What For |
|------------|---------|
| **Shopify** | Sales data, refunds, discounts |
| **Stripe** | Payment processing, payouts, fees |
| **Google Sheets** | P&L templates, dashboards |
| **the accounting system** | ERP — invoicing, payment reconciliation, accounting |
| **the expense platform** | Corporate cards, expense tracking, bank statements |
| **Bank feeds** (via accounting software) | Cash position, reconciliation |
| **the POS/inventory system** | COGS data, purchase orders |
| **Google Drive** | Invoice storage, report archive |

## Real Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Time to weekly P&L | 8 hours | 45 minutes | -91% |
| Financial data lag | 2-3 weeks | Real-time | -100% |
| Invoice processing time | 2 days avg | 2 hours | -96% |
| Reconciliation errors/month | 15 | 2 | -87% |
| Cash flow visibility | 1 week ahead | 4 weeks ahead | +300% |

## The Most Valuable Output: Pattern Detection

The real magic isn't in automating reports — it's in seeing patterns humans miss:

- "Wholesale account X has increased payment terms from 30 to 45 days over the last 3 invoices. Flag for relationship review."
- "Shipping cost as % of revenue has increased from 8.2% to 9.7% over 6 weeks. At current trend, this erodes margin significantly over a full year."
- "Revenue from UK customers dropped 22% after the price increase. Other markets unaffected. Consider UK-specific pricing."

These insights exist in the data. Humans just don't have time to look for them.

3. Classifies by category (supplier, utilities, services, etc.)
4. Uploads to Google Drive in organized month/sender folders
5. Logs to a reconciliation tracking spreadsheet
6. First batch: 117 invoices auto-processed from 2 months of email backlog. Zero manual data entry.

**Bank Credit Line Monitoring**

- Daily alerts if amortizations are due within 48 hours
- Weekly summaries on Mondays
- Monthly overviews on the 1st
- Color-coded urgency levels
